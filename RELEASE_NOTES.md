- **Dynamic lifts:**
  - (Improvement) Remove the 'light-off delay' set logic as it is now better integrated on 'Wait time before cure' suggestion and should run/applied there if intended
  - (Fix) Prevent set NaN values to lift height and/or speed
  - (Fix) Lift height and speed for the current layer must be calculated from previous layer (#618)
- (Improvement) Windows auto-updater will install the update without dialogs, just displaying installation progress
