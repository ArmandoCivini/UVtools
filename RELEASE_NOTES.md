- **UI:**
  - (Improvement) Layer navigation load time by parallel `Mat` to `Bitmap` conversion
  - (Improvement) Allow to show exceptions without the stack trace and detailed trigger action by using the `MessageExceiption` (#644)
  - (Improvement) Allow progress to have and display a detailed log (#644)
  - (Improvement) Convert format to another with multiple versions will now only show the possible versions for the extension
- **Suggestion - Wait time before cure:**
  - (Improvement) Set the first wait time based on first valid layer mass rather than use the fixed limit
  - (Improvement) Set zero time to empty and dummy layers
  - (Improvement) When creating the dummy layer also increment the bottom layer count as the created layer count as one
- **PCB Exposure:**
  - (Add) Excellon Drill Format (drl) to cut off holes (Implementation may lack some advanced features, please confirm the result) (#646)
  - (Fix) Arc (G03) with negative offsets (I-/J-) was not drawing the shape correctly
  - (Fix) Implement the rotation for the outline primitive (#645)
- **File formats:**
  - (Improvement) Formats now sanitize the selected version before encode given the file extension, if version is out of range it will force the last known version
  - (Fix) CBDDLP: Remove a table from the file that might cause layer corruption
- (Add) Operations - `AfterCompleteReport` property: Gets or sets an report to show to the user after complete the operation with success
- (Improvement) Suggestion - Wait time after cure: Set zero time to empty and dummy layers
- (Improvement) Slight improvement on the contour intersection check, yields better performance on resin and suction cup detection
- (Improvement) Allow to trigger message boxes from operations and scripts (#644)
- (Upgrade) .NET from 6.0.12 to 6.0.13
