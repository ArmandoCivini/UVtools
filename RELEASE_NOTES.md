- **Core:**
   - (Add) Getter `FileFormat.DisplayPixelCount` Gets the display total number of pixels (ResolutionX * ResolutionY)
   - (Add) Getter `Layer.NonZeroPixelRatio` Gets the ratio between non zero pixels and display number of pixels
   - (Add) Getter `Layer.NonZeroPixelPercentage` Gets the percentage of non zero pixels relative to the display number of pixels
   - (Add) Getter `Layer.PreviousHeightLayer()` Gets the previous layer with a different height from the current, returns null if no previous layer
   - (Add) Getter `Layer.NextHeightLayer()` Gets the next layer with a different height from the current, returns null if no next layer
   - (Add) Method `Layer.GetPreviousLayerWithAtLeastPixelCountOf()` Gets the previous layer matching at least a number of pixels, returns null if no previous layer
   - (Add) Method `Layer.GetNextLayerWithAtLeastPixelCountOf()` Gets the next layer matching at least a number of pixels, returns null if no next layer
   - (Add) Method `Operation.GetRoiOrVolumeBounds()` returns the selected ROI rectangle or model volume bounds rectangle
   - (Add) Documentation around `Operation` methods
   - (Fix) Open files in partial mode when the resolution is not defined would cause a `NullPointerException` (#474)
- **Suggestion: Wait time before cure**
   - (Add) Proportional maximum time change: Sets the maximum allowed time difference relative to the previous layer (#471)
   - (Add) Proportional mass get modes: Previous, Average and Maximum relative to a defined height (#471)
   - (Change) Proportional set type sets fallback time to the first layer
   - (Fix) Proportional set type was taking current layer mass instead of looking to the previous cured layer (#471)
- **Tools:**
   - **Edit print parameters:**
      - (Change) Incorporate the unit label into the numeric input box
      - (Change) Allow TSMC speeds to be 0 as minimum value (#472)
   - (Fix) PCB Exposure: The thumbnail has random noise around the image
- **Settings:**
   - (Add) Tools: "Always prompt for confirmation before execute the operation"
   - (Fix) Changing layer compression method when no file is loaded would cause a error
- **UI:**
   - (Add) Holding Shift key while drag and drop a .uvtop file will try to execute the operation without showing the window or prompt
   - (Add) Drag and drop a .cs or .csx file into UVtools will load and show the scripting dialog with the file selected
- (Add) Errors that crash application will now show an report window with the crash information and able to fast report them
- (Upgrade) AvaloniaUI from 0.10.13 to 0.10.14
- (Upgrade) .NET from 6.0.4 to 6.0.5
